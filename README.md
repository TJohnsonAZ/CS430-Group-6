# Usage
To create the object file that runs the program, type "make all" into your command line and it will create "raytrace". To execute it, write "./raytrace" followed by three arguments: width, height, input file (.csv), and output file (.ppm). To reset, type "make clean" into your command line and it will remove any object and miscellaneous files.
  
# Known Issues
- Object reflections will occasionally be colored in with the maximum color value of what is being reflected.
