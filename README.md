# Usage
To compile and run the program, type "make all" into your command line and it will create all necessary object files and execute with the parameters in the "get_frames" rule of the MakeFile. These parameters are as follows: image width, image height, input file, x position, and y position. The last two parameters determine what position in the scene the object will move to in the animated gif file the program produces. To reset, type "make clean" into your command line and it will remove any object and miscellaneous files.
